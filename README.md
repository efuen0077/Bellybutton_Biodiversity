## Challenge
#### Goals
1. Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel. Use JavaScript to select only the    most populous species.
2. Create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s    navel.
3. Complete the demographic information panel.

#### Description Of This Project
During the making of this project, I created 5 functions that took care of certain information for me. These functions helped select the dataset, created an "options" button where one was able to choose which ID they wanted to analyze, built horizontal charts as well as bubble charts according to ID. Lasty, the most interesting function that I dealt with was the buildGauge function, which created a gauge according to ID as well.

The interactive charts are very useful on the client's side in that they do not need to know how to code in order to analyze the data on their own. All that the client would need to do is navigate to the link and select one ID at a time. This provides a sense of efficiency in a business.
